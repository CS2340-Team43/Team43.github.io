The game designed by Team 43 looks like your average dungeon scroller game but there are some key standouts. The game contains three game screens, all based on Greek lore. Players can choose between 3 different avatars, either Zeus, Poseidon, or Hades, and enter their own gamer tag. Once a player commences the game they have to navigate to the ending location while avoiding the challenging enemies. The twist is that the players do not know what section of the map advances them to the next room so they have to be wiley with how they avoid the enemies and search for the next room.
There are 2 basic types of enemies, a Sprite and a Heavy enemy. The Sprite is present in the first and last game screens and does minimal damage to the player. There are three different types of Heavy enemies that do much more damage to the player than the Sprite. Each enemy was uniquely designed to exemplify a base fear of the human race and they appear eerie to look at.
If a player is able to make it through all three game screens while avoiding death their name will be added to the leaderboard and their score displayed.
This game will launch on the Playstore soon and is expected to be the highest grossing game of all time.
Below is an example of the game running:
